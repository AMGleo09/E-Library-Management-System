# E-Library-Management-System
The E-Library Management System is a web-based application built using ASP.NET, C#, and ADO.NET, incorporating both connected and disconnected database architectures. The project uses master pages to create a consistent layout across pages, with a navigation bar offering links to Home, About, Terms, View Books, User Login, and Signup. It demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and efficient session management to provide personalized user experiences.

When users log in, a session is created, displaying "Logout" and "User Details" options in the navigation bar, enabling them to update profiles and change passwords. For admin users, a separate session activates additional management features in the footer, including Author Management, Publisher Management, Book Inventory, Book Issuing, and Member Management. This ensures role-based access to resources and functionality.

The project highlights proficiency in ASP.NET for developing robust and scalable web applications. It integrates key concepts like OOP, session handling, and ADO.NET for structured data management, demonstrating the ability to create secure and user-friendly applications with customizable access controls.
